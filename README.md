# Conversational RAG with PDF & Chat History

A Streamlit-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that enables users to upload PDFs and interact with their content through conversational queries. The app leverages HuggingFace embeddings for semantic search, Cassandra/ChromaDB as a vector store, and Groq LLM for context-aware Q&A. It also maintains session-based chat history to provide continuity in conversations.
